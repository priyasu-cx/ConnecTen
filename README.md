<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many ways to connect with everyone in any meet-ups or gatherings; however, I didn't find it easy and that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced app. I want to create a connection building ap so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on engaging and interacting with amazing people. An app that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like sharing all your social links again and again. 
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one app will serve all purpose since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

Use this app to help seamlessly connect with everyone present in any gatherings or in-person meet-ups.
